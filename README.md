### Goals

- **No javascript**
- Crawl multiple index sites for torrents and magnet links.
- Easily integrates with both [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr) and [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr).
- Run without ceremony. No need for configurations.
- Easy to understand source code. Special care is taken to keep code lean and understandable.
- High performance, leveraging Elixir's GenServer and Erlang's BEAM VM.

We work closely with other providers and search engines to be respectful of their hardware and minimize our impact to their systems.

If you'd like us to add you to our supported vendors list, please drop us a Github Issue.
